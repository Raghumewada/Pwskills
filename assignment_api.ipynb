    "API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application or system to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, making it possible for different software components to communicate and work together. APIs are fundamental in modern software development, enabling developers to access services, libraries, or data provided by other applications or platforms.\n",
