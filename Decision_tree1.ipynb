    "A decision tree classifier algorithm creates a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the feature that results in the most significant information gain (or least impurity). Each node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf represents an outcome."
