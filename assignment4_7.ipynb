    "Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should possess, while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows you to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",
