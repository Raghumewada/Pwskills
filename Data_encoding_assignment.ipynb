    "Ans:-Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into numerical format, but they differ in the nature of the categorical data they handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical variables have an inherent order or ranking. For example, the sizes \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\" have a clear order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, on the other hand, assigns a unique integer to each category without considering any order. It simply converts each category into a numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example scenario where you might choose one over the other is in a dataset with a \"T-shirt size\" variable. If the sizes are \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large,\" you would use ordinal encoding because there's a natural order to the sizes. However, if the categories were simply labels like \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" you would use label encoding."
