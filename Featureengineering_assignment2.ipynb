    "Ans:-Min-Max scaling transforms features to a specific range (usually 0 to 1). Example: Scaling ages from 20-40 to 0-1.Min-Max scaling transforms features to a specific range, commonly between 0 and 1. It's used in data preprocessing to ensure that different features are on a similar scale, preventing features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. For example, if you have a dataset of ages ranging from 20 to 40 years, Min-Max scaling would transform these ages to values between 0 and 1."

    "Ans:-The Unit Vector technique, also known as normalization, scales features so that each sample has a unit norm (magnitude of 1), maintaining their direction. Unlike Min-Max scaling, it doesn't focus on the range but rather on the direction of the data vectors. For instance, if you have a dataset with features representing height and weight, unit vector scaling would ensure that each sample has a magnitude of 1 without altering their direction."

    "Ans:-A (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform data into a new coordinate system while retaining most of the variance in the data. It achieves this by identifying orthogonal axes (principal components) along which the variance is maximized. For example, if you have a dataset with multiple features, PCA can help reduce it to a lower-dimensional space while preserving most of the information."

    "Ans:-PCA can be used for feature extraction by identifying the most important features (principal components) that explain the variance in the data. Instead of using the original features, you can use the principal components as new features. For example, in financial data analysis, PCA can extract features representing different market trends from a dataset containing various financial indicators."
